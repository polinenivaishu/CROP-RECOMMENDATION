# CROP-RECOMMENDATION 

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset and code for a Crop Recommendation System. The system is designed to recommend suitable crops based on various agricultural factors. The dataset includes information on nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH value, rainfall, and corresponding labels indicating the recommended crop.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format with the following columns:

- Nitrogen: The nitrogen content in the soil.
- Phosphorous: The phosphorous content in the soil.
- Potassium: The potassium content in the soil.
- Temperature: The temperature of the agricultural region.
- Humidity: The humidity level in the atmosphere.
- pH Value: The pH value of the soil.
- Rainfall: The amount of rainfall in the region.
- Label: The recommended crop based on the input factors.


## Usage

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
   - Explore the dataset using the provided Jupyter notebook or any other analysis tool.

2. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - Clean and preprocess the data if necessary. Handle missing values and outliers.

3. *Model Training:*
   - Use the dataset to train a machine learning model for crop recommendation.

4. *Prediction:*
   - Use the trained model to predict the recommended crop based on input agricultural factors.
